# Feedback from Ballot CH Core STU 5 

## General information
The STU 5 ballot ([IG v5.0.0-ballot](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-core/5.0.0-ballot/index.html)) was held from August 6 to September 30, 2024. The annual [EPR Projectathon](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/technik/epd-projectathon/epr-projectathon-2024) took place from September 16-20, 2024, with the opportunity to [test](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/EPD-Projectathon2024_Profiles_List.pdf) and provide feedback on the CH Core-based exchange formats and thus also CH Core.   
During the ballot, [3 issues](https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22STU+5+Ballot%22) were reported. Here is a brief summary of them.

### Documentation
* [#293](https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-core/issues/293): Improve the description of Patient.gender so that it is more consistent with the constraint on this element.

### Profiling
* [#294](https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-core/issues/294): Differentiation of the constraint grade between the profiles CH Core Patient (warning) and CH Core Patient EPR (error) for the constraint 'ch-pat-1' for patient name.

### Feature Request
* [#299](https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-core/issues/299): 
   * Add guidance for the [RESTful use](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/http.html), including the [SMART on FHIR mechanism](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/).
   * Compatibility with the [International Patient Access (IPA) specification](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/).
   * Define formal descriptions of capabilities per actor (server/client), e.g. [IPA-Patient](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/StructureDefinition-ipa-patient.html). See also [implementation Obligations](https://build.fhir.org/obligations.html).
   * Clarification of the relationship to the EPR and the supported exchange mechanisms.
