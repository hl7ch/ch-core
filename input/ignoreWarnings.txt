# The following code systems/value sets/codes cannot be validated (external systems)
Code System URI 'http://ihe.net/fhir/ValueSet/IHE.FormatCode.codesystem' is unknown so the code cannot be validated
The code '1141000195107' comes from the system urn:oid:2.16.756.5.30.1.127.3.4 which is unknown, so it's not known whether it's valid in the value set 'http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-epr-term/ValueSet/DocumentEntry.confidentialityCode'

The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version {3} is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this element is [[BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)
